                    <p>
                        Mr. W., a 63-year-old man, presents to oncology for suspicion of
                        prostate cancer following abnormal DRE and PSA findings. One week
                        ago, he presented to his GP for an annual routine physical exam.
                        Physical examination revealed an enlarged and palpable prostate
                        during DRE, and laboratory studies showed an elevated PSA level of
                        125.1 ng/mL. Based on these findings and a high index of
                        suspicion for prostate cancer, Mr. W. was referred to oncology by
                        his GP for further evaluation and workup. He is asymptomatic and
                        denies any urinary symptoms or other complaints.
